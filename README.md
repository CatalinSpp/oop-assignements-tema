# Homework - GwentStone

## A fully functional project written in Java inspired from games like Hearthstone or Gwent

This project was built along with an OCW-OOP Courses presenting how to implement a custom game for a start-up. Every
part of this project is effective code which shows how to do the following:

* Create a structure which offers an easy way of transforming an input in different models(ActionFactory, CardsFactory)
* Parse, generate, read and write JSON objects
* Create a Card Hierarchy
* Add support for debug commands 
* Avoid writing long methods and splitting them into multiple methods at suitable logic points
